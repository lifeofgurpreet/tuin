# SEATING ZONE - GENERATION PROMPT

## Task

Generate a design visualization for the seating area of this garden.

## Reference Images (IN ORDER)

1. **Annotated space photos** - This is the ACTUAL garden. Image 1 is AUTHORITATIVE - your design must match THIS space exactly. Use the annotated dimensions and features as your constraints.
2. **Inspiration images** - Style references for seating furniture and layout. Match the mood, not exact proportions.
3. **Layout drawing** (if provided) - Top-down view showing seating placement.

## Design Requirements

- Seating must fit within the actual garden space
- Position near or under the shade structure for comfort
- Clear line of sight to play area (for supervising children)
- Natural materials preferred

## Elements to Include

- **Dining table** with chairs (4-6 seats) - solid timber or weathered teak
- **Lounging area** (optional) - low bench or daybed with linen cushions
- **Side tables** - natural stone or matching timber
- **Ambient lighting** - warm-white string lights overhead, lanterns on table

## Materials

- Furniture: Teak, robinia, or Douglas fir (oiled, not painted)
- Cushions/textiles: Linen or canvas in muted earth tones (sand, olive, warm grey)
- Surface underfoot: Natural stone pavers, gravel, or timber deck
- Accents: Terracotta pots, woven baskets, corten steel planters

## Cross-Zone References

- This area sits under or beside the shade structure - integrate, don't isolate
- Must maintain clear sightlines to the play area for child supervision
- Planting should frame the seating area, creating a sense of enclosure without blocking views
- Path from seating to play area should be direct and unobstructed

## DO NOT

- Block pathways or access points
- Place seating where it obstructs garden flow
- Use materials inconsistent with the garden style (no plastic, no chrome)
- Create a fully enclosed space that blocks views to play area
