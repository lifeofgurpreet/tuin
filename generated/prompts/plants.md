# PLANTS ZONE - GENERATION PROMPT

## Task

Generate a design visualization for the planting areas of this garden.

## Reference Images (IN ORDER)

1. **Annotated space photos** - This is the ACTUAL garden. Respect existing plants and features.
2. **Inspiration images** - Style references for planting design.
3. **Layout drawing** (if provided) - Top-down view showing planting zones.

## Design Requirements

- Work with existing plants visible in space photos
- Layer planting: ground cover -> mid-height -> tall/screening
- Consider sun/shade patterns noted in annotations
- Create natural, organic boundaries between zones

## Planting Approach

- Border planting along fences/walls
- Feature plants for focal points
- Ground cover for bare areas
- Screening plants for privacy where needed
- Herbs/edibles near kitchen access if applicable

## DO NOT

- Remove existing healthy plants/trees
- Suggest plants unsuitable for the climate
- Over-plant - leave breathing room
