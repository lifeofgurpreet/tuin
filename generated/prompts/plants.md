# PLANTS ZONE - GENERATION PROMPT

## Task

Generate a design visualization for the planting areas of this garden.

## Reference Images (IN ORDER)

1. **Annotated space photos** - This is the ACTUAL garden. Image 1 is AUTHORITATIVE - your design must match THIS space exactly. Respect every existing plant and feature visible.
2. **Inspiration images** - Style references for planting design. Match the mood and density.
3. **Layout drawing** (if provided) - Top-down view showing planting zones.

## Design Requirements

- Work with existing plants visible in space photos - do not remove or replace healthy specimens
- Layer planting: ground cover -> mid-height -> tall/screening
- Consider sun/shade patterns noted in annotations
- Create natural, organic boundaries between zones

## Planting Approach

- **Border planting** along fences/walls - mixed herbaceous with structural evergreens
- **Feature plants** for focal points - ornamental grasses (Miscanthus, Stipa), specimen tree
- **Ground cover** for bare areas - Pachysandra, Vinca, Geranium macrorrhizum
- **Screening plants** for privacy - Photinia, Prunus laurocerasus, bamboo (clumping only)
- **Herbs/edibles** near kitchen access - rosemary, lavender, thyme, bay laurel
- **Climbing plants** on fences/pergola - Trachelospermum, Clematis, Hydrangea petiolaris

## Specific Plant Examples

| Layer | Examples | Height |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Ground cover | Ajuga, Alchemilla mollis, Heuchera | 10-30cm |
| Low perennials | Lavandula, Salvia, Nepeta | 30-60cm |
| Mid-height | Hydrangea, Euonymus, Viburnum | 60-150cm |
| Tall/screening | Photinia, bamboo (Fargesia), Amelanchier | 150-300cm |
| Climbers | Jasmine, Clematis, Wisteria | 200-500cm |

## Cross-Zone References

- Planting softens edges around the shade structure and seating area
- Low planting near play area boundary so children remain visible
- Taller screening on boundaries for privacy, not between internal zones
- Use aromatic plants (lavender, rosemary) near seating for sensory pleasure

## DO NOT

- Remove existing healthy plants/trees
- Suggest plants unsuitable for temperate maritime climate
- Over-plant - leave breathing room and paths between beds
- Use tall dense planting between seating and play area (blocks supervision)
