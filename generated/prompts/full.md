# FULL GARDEN - GENERATION PROMPT

## Task

Generate a complete design visualization showing the entire garden with all zones integrated.

## Reference Images (IN ORDER)

1. **Annotated space photos** - This is the ACTUAL garden. Image 1 is AUTHORITATIVE - your design MUST match this space exactly. Every dimension and feature matters.
2. **Inspiration images** - Style references for the overall garden feel.
3. **Layout drawing** (if provided) - Top-down master plan.

## Zones to Include

1. **Shade structure** - Covered area for weather protection (timber pergola or shade sail)
2. **Seating area** - Dining and lounging under/near shade
3. **Planting zones** - Borders, feature plants, ground cover
4. **Play area** - Children's natural play space (MUST be visible from seating)
5. **Pathways** - Connecting all zones naturally

## Integration Flow

The zones should feel like one garden, not separate rooms:

```
[Shade + Seating] --soft planting border--> [Lawn / Open space] --low hedge--> [Play Area]
        |                                          |
   [Border planting along fences]          [Path connects all zones]
```

- Shade and seating are one integrated area (seating under shade)
- Open lawn or gravel connects to play area with clear sightlines
- Border planting wraps the perimeter (fences, walls)
- Paths are informal: stepping stones or gravel, not rigid concrete
- Material palette is consistent throughout (same timber, same stone, same tones)

## Integration Rules

- All zones must flow together naturally
- Pathways should connect zones without awkward transitions
- Consistent material palette throughout (see system_prompt.md)
- Planting should soften boundaries between zones
- No zone should feel isolated or disconnected

## DO NOT

- Treat zones as isolated islands with hard borders between them
- Ignore existing garden features
- Create a design that doesn't match the real space proportions
- Mix conflicting material styles (e.g., modern steel in one zone, rustic wood in another)
