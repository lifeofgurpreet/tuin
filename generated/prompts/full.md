# FULL GARDEN - GENERATION PROMPT

## Task

Generate a complete design visualization showing the entire garden with all zones integrated.

## Reference Images (IN ORDER)

1. **Annotated space photos** - This is the ACTUAL garden. Design MUST match this space.
2. **Inspiration images** - Style references for the overall garden feel.
3. **Layout drawing** (if provided) - Top-down master plan.

## Zones to Include

1. **Shade structure** - Covered area for weather protection
2. **Seating area** - Dining and lounging under/near shade
3. **Planting zones** - Borders, features, ground cover
4. **Play area** - Children's natural play space (visible from seating)
5. **Pathways** - Connecting all zones naturally

## Integration Rules

- All zones must flow together naturally
- Pathways should connect zones without awkward transitions
- Consistent material palette throughout
- Planting should soften boundaries between zones

## DO NOT

- Treat zones as isolated islands
- Ignore existing garden features
- Create a design that doesn't match the real space proportions
