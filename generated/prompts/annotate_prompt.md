# ANNOTATION TASK

You are looking at photos of a garden space. Your job is to annotate this image with useful labels for a garden designer.

## What to Label

1. **Dimensions** - Estimate approximate dimensions of the space (width x depth)
2. **Sun direction** - Based on shadows and light, indicate sun direction with an arrow
3. **Existing features** - Label walls, fences, trees, paths, structures
4. **Boundaries** - Mark property boundaries and neighbouring features
5. **Grade/slope** - Note any elevation changes
6. **Soil/surface** - Label visible surface types (grass, concrete, soil, gravel)
7. **Access points** - Mark doors, gates, pathways entering the space

## Style

- Use clear, readable labels with arrows pointing to features
- Use a consistent color scheme (white text on dark background, or colored arrows)
- Keep annotations clean and professional
- Number each feature for easy reference

## Output

Generate an annotated version of this image with all labels clearly visible.
