# ANNOTATION TASK

You are looking at photos of a garden space. Your job is to annotate this image with useful labels for a garden designer.

## What to Label

Create a numbered list of features. For each, add a clear label with an arrow on the image.

1. **Dimensions** - Estimate width x depth in METERS (e.g., "~8m wide", "~12m deep")
2. **Sun direction** - Based on shadows and light, draw an arrow showing sun direction with "SUN" label
3. **Existing features** - Label walls, fences, trees, paths, sheds, structures
4. **Boundaries** - Mark property lines and neighbouring features (e.g., "neighbour fence 1.8m")
5. **Grade/slope** - Note any elevation changes (e.g., "slopes ~30cm down towards back")
6. **Soil/surface** - Label visible surfaces (grass, concrete, soil, gravel, paving)
7. **Access points** - Mark doors, gates, pathways entering the space

## Label Format

Use this consistent format for each annotation:

```
[1] Back fence - timber, ~1.8m high, 6m wide
[2] Mature apple tree - ~4m height, 3m canopy
[3] Concrete patio - ~3m x 4m
[4] Lawn area - ~5m x 8m, mostly flat
[5] Side gate - access to front garden
```

## Style

- Use clear, readable labels with arrows pointing to features
- White text on semi-transparent dark background for readability
- Number each feature sequentially [1], [2], [3], etc.
- Keep annotations clean and professional
- Use consistent arrow colors (e.g., yellow arrows for measurements, red for sun direction)

## Output

Generate an annotated version of this image with all numbered labels clearly visible. All measurements should be in meters.
