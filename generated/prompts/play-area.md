# PLAY AREA - GENERATION PROMPT

## Task

Generate a design visualization for the children's nature play area in this garden.

## Reference Images (IN ORDER)

1. **Annotated space photos** - This is the ACTUAL garden. Your design MUST fit this space.
2. **Inspiration images** - Style references for natural play elements.
3. **Layout drawing** (if provided) - Top-down view showing play area placement.

## Design Requirements

- MUST be visible from the seating area (line of sight for supervision)
- Natural materials only (wood, rope, sand, stone)
- Safe surfaces (grass, bark mulch, sand)
- Age-appropriate for young children

## Elements to Consider

- Sand pit
- Log stepping stones
- Low climbing structure (natural wood)
- Small mound / hill
- Sensory garden elements (textured plants, wind chimes)
- Water play feature (optional)

## DO NOT

- Use plastic playground equipment
- Place play area hidden from seating
- Include elements with sharp edges or fall hazards
- Overcomplicate - keep it simple and natural
