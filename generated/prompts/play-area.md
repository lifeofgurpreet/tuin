# PLAY AREA - GENERATION PROMPT

## Task

Generate a design visualization for the children's nature play area in this garden.

## Reference Images (IN ORDER)

1. **Annotated space photos** - This is the ACTUAL garden. Image 1 is AUTHORITATIVE - your design must match THIS space exactly. The play area must fit the real dimensions.
2. **Inspiration images** - Style references for natural play elements.
3. **Layout drawing** (if provided) - Top-down view showing play area placement.

## Design Requirements

- **CRITICAL**: MUST be visible from the seating area (line of sight for supervision - no tall barriers between seating and play)
- Natural materials only (wood, rope, sand, stone)
- Safe surfaces (grass, bark mulch, sand)
- Age-appropriate for young children (2-7 years)

## Elements to Consider

- **Sand pit** - timber-edged, ~1.5m x 1.5m, with cover option
- **Log stepping stones** - varying heights (15-40cm), natural round logs
- **Low climbing structure** - robinia or larch timber, max 1.2m high
- **Small mound / hill** - grass-covered earth mound for climbing/rolling
- **Sensory garden** - textured plants (lamb's ear, grasses), wind chimes, smooth stones
- **Water play** (optional) - simple hand pump or shallow water channel

## Materials

- Timber: Robinia (naturally rot-resistant) for all structural play elements
- Sand: Washed play sand, not builder's sand
- Surfacing: Bark mulch (30cm depth) around climbing elements for fall protection
- Edging: Natural log rounds or sandstone blocks
- Rope: Natural hemp or sisal for any rope features

## Cross-Zone References

- Play area MUST be visible from seating area - position accordingly
- Low planting (max 60cm) on boundary between play and seating zones
- Path connecting play area to seating should be short and clear
- Shade from nearby trees or shade structure is beneficial but not required

## DO NOT

- Use plastic playground equipment
- Place play area hidden from seating (supervision is critical)
- Include elements with sharp edges or fall hazards above 1.2m
- Overcomplicate - keep it simple and natural
- Use pressure-treated timber near sand pit (chemical leaching)
- Place directly under large trees with heavy branch-drop risk
