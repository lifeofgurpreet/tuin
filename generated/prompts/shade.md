# SHADE ZONE - GENERATION PROMPT

## Task

Generate a design visualization for the shade area of this garden.

## Reference Images (IN ORDER)

1. **Annotated space photos** - This is the ACTUAL garden. Your design MUST fit this space.
2. **Inspiration images** - Style references for the shade structure.
3. **Layout drawing** (if provided) - Top-down view showing where the shade goes.

## Design Requirements

- Shade structure must fit within the actual garden dimensions shown in annotated photos
- Respect existing features (walls, trees, paths) visible in space photos
- Integrate naturally with surrounding garden
- Consider sun direction noted in annotations

## Style Options (pick based on inspiration refs)

- Shade sail (modern, clean)
- Pergola with climbing plants (natural, organic)
- Tree canopy (long-term, natural)
- Combination approach

## DO NOT

- Ignore the actual space dimensions
- Place structures over existing features
- Create designs that look nothing like the real garden
- Add elements not related to the shade zone
