# SHADE ZONE - GENERATION PROMPT

## Task

Generate a design visualization for the shade area of this garden.

## Reference Images (IN ORDER)

1. **Annotated space photos** - This is the ACTUAL garden. Image 1 is AUTHORITATIVE - your design must match THIS space exactly. Use the annotated dimensions and features as your constraints.
2. **Inspiration images** - Style references for the shade structure. Match the mood and feel, not exact proportions.
3. **Layout drawing** (if provided) - Top-down view showing where the shade goes.

## Design Requirements

- Shade structure must fit within the actual garden dimensions shown in annotated photos
- Respect existing features (walls, trees, paths) visible in space photos
- Integrate naturally with surrounding garden
- Consider sun direction noted in annotations
- Position so seating area beneath/beside can see the play area (line of sight)

## Style Options (pick based on inspiration refs)

- **Shade sail** - Canvas in earthy tones (sand, warm grey, olive), mounted to timber posts or existing wall
- **Pergola** - Douglas fir or larch timber, open-top with optional climbing plants (wisteria, jasmine, grape vine)
- **Tree canopy** - Existing or new trees providing dappled shade
- **Combination** - Pergola with partial shade sail for rain protection

## Materials

- Timber posts: Douglas fir or larch, oiled finish (honey-brown tone)
- Shade fabric: Canvas or woven sail in sand/warm grey
- Hardware: Black iron or weathered steel brackets
- Ground beneath: Natural stone pavers or compacted gravel

## Cross-Zone References

- The seating area sits beneath or adjacent to this shade structure
- Ensure the play area remains visible from under the shade (don't create a solid wall)
- Planting zones should soften the edges of the shade structure

## DO NOT

- Ignore the actual space dimensions
- Place structures over existing features
- Create designs that look nothing like the real garden
- Add elements not related to the shade zone
- Use bright white fabric or shiny metal
- Block sightlines to the play area
