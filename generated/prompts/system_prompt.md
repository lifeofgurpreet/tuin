# EVELIEN GARDEN - SYSTEM RULES

## Garden Overview

**Project:** Evelien Garden Design
**Type:** Residential garden with shade, seating, planting, and children's play area

## Design Zones

| Zone | Purpose | Key Elements |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **Shade** | Covered area for shelter | Shade sail / pergola / natural canopy |
| **Plants** | Green planting areas | Native plants, hedges, ground cover |
| **Seating** | Outdoor dining / relaxation | Tables, chairs, benches |
| **Play Area** | Children's nature play | Natural materials, safe surfaces |

## Critical Constraints

1. **Match the real space** - Generated designs MUST respect the actual garden dimensions and layout
2. **Preserve existing features** - Walls, fences, trees, and structures visible in space photos must remain
3. **Natural materials** - Prefer wood, stone, natural fabrics over plastic/metal where possible
4. **Sun/shade awareness** - Shade structures should be positioned based on annotated sun direction
5. **Safety** - Play area must be visible from seating area (line of sight)

## Material Palette

Use these materials consistently across all zones:

| Category | Preferred Materials | Avoid |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| **Wood** | Douglas fir, larch, robinia (untreated or oiled) | Pressure-treated pine, painted wood |
| **Stone** | Natural sandstone, cobblestone, gravel | Polished marble, bright white stone |
| **Fabric** | Canvas shade sails, linen cushions | Plastic tarps, synthetic mesh |
| **Metal** | Weathered corten steel accents, black iron | Chrome, shiny aluminium |
| **Ground** | Bark mulch, gravel, natural stone pavers | Concrete slabs, rubber tiles |

## Color Direction

- **Earthy tones**: warm greys, sandy beige, moss green, terracotta
- **Wood tones**: honey, weathered silver-grey, warm brown
- **Accents**: muted olive green, dusty blue, warm white
- **Avoid**: bright primary colors, stark white, black

## Style Direction

- Natural, organic, warm
- Not overly manicured - relaxed garden feel
- Integration with existing landscape
- Sustainable materials where possible

### What "relaxed garden" looks like:
- Gravel paths with soft edges (not razor-straight borders)
- Plants spilling slightly over edges
- Mix of textures: rough wood, smooth stone, soft grasses
- Weathered finishes that look lived-in, not showroom-new
- Asymmetric arrangements that feel natural, not rigidly geometric
