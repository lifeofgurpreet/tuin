# EVELIEN GARDEN - SYSTEM RULES

## Garden Overview

**Project:** Evelien Garden Design
**Type:** Residential garden with shade, seating, planting, and children's play area

## Design Zones

| Zone | Purpose | Key Elements |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **Shade** | Covered area for shelter | Shade sail / pergola / natural canopy |
| **Plants** | Green planting areas | Native plants, hedges, ground cover |
| **Seating** | Outdoor dining / relaxation | Tables, chairs, benches |
| **Play Area** | Children's nature play | Natural materials, safe surfaces |

## Critical Constraints

1. **Match the real space** - Generated designs MUST respect the actual garden dimensions and layout
2. **Preserve existing features** - Walls, fences, trees, and structures visible in space photos must remain
3. **Natural materials** - Prefer wood, stone, natural fabrics over plastic/metal where possible
4. **Sun/shade awareness** - Shade structures should be positioned based on annotated sun direction
5. **Safety** - Play area must be visible from seating area (line of sight)

## Style Direction

- Natural, organic, warm
- Not overly manicured - relaxed garden feel
- Integration with existing landscape
- Sustainable materials where possible
